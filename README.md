# My Personal Experiment

Powering my personal experimental site, [ethernick.com](http://ethernick.com). 

From time to time I make things ugly and way too complex... but isn't that experimenting? learning? improving?

### Experiment #1: XML, XSLT & SEO

If you look closely, it's all xml & xsl. If you look at the source... it's not what google picks up. Not sure what the relevance or impact of this is... I just found it odd.

### Experiment #2: A fan of SVG

I'm a fan of how flexible SVG is. I also want to see how it would interact with XSLT

### Experiment #3: Girlify

I like the girlify look. So with [cheet.js](https://github.com/namuol/cheet.js) & [XColor](https://github.com/infusion/jQuery-xcolor), I made things nice and chunky
